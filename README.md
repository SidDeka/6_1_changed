Changes made to Code module, PC serial communication module, display module. Addition of the servo motor module.
Changes made to smart home system module and user interface module.


Purpose of the code:
To achieve objective of adding a gated entry feature to a smart house system. The goal of this design is to provide secure access to the house through the implementation of a 4-key passcode protected gate, which is simulated by a positional servo motor. The gated entry system will have a user interface that includes a character LCD display and Matrix Keypad, which will be used to display instructions and the passcode as it is entered by the user.
