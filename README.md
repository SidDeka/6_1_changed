Purpose of the code:
To achieve objective of adding a gated entry feature to a smart house system. The goal of this design is to provide secure access to the house through the implementation of a 4-key passcode protected gate, which is simulated by a positional servo motor. The gated entry system will have a user interface that includes a character LCD display and Matrix Keypad, which will be used to display instructions and the passcode as it is entered by the user.
